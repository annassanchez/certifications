## Overview

The AWS Global Infrastructure facilitates the deployment of AWS services that meet business needs. AWS tools provide cloud technicians with methods to deploy and manage AWS resources. In this course, discover how regions and availability zones affect resource placement and high availability. Then, consider how shared responsibility applies to AWS services, explore the AWS Well-Architected Framework, and match AWS services to business needs. Next, get the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and PowerShell tools running on the Windows and Linux platforms to enable AWS management. Lastly, use CloudShell for command line management and recognize how AWS Outposts allow the use of AWS services on-premises. This course can be used to prepare for exam SAA-C03, AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate.
